## Usage

The first step while using this application is when users click on the green button to create a new task card. Then, users input the data required by the modal window by typing text into the text boxes and selecting a date from the date picker widget. After users click on "Submit" and create a task card, they can find it on the first lane, which is called, "To Do." Users can drag the card around and drop it on any lane they choose. They can also sort cards within the same lane and delete them upon clicking on the red button called "DELETE."
